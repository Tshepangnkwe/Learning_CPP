# Learning C++

Welcome to my "Learning C++" repository! ðŸš€

This repository documents my journey of mastering the C++ programming language. Whether you're a fellow learner or just curious, feel free to explore the code, notes, and projects I'm working on.

## Learning Path

I'm following a structured learning path to gradually build my C++ skills:

1. **C++ Basics:** Explore the fundamental concepts of C++.
2. **Control Flow:** Learn about loops, conditionals, and branching.
3. **Functions and Objects:** Understand functions, classes, and object-oriented programming.
4. **Memory Management:** Dive into memory allocation, pointers, and dynamic memory.
5. **Templates and STL:** Discover C++ templates and the Standard Template Library.
6. **Advanced Topics:** Tackle more advanced topics like multithreading and file handling.

## Code Chronicles

In the [`code-examples`](./code-examples) directory, you'll find a growing collection of C++ code snippets that I've been working on. Each snippet corresponds to a specific concept I'm learning. Feel free to browse, learn, and provide feedback!

## Challenges and Projects

The [`challenges`](./challenges) folder contains coding challenges and mini-projects that I've completed to reinforce my learning. These projects vary in complexity and cover a wide range of C++ features.

## Deep Dives

I'm documenting my understanding of complex topics in the [`deep-dives`](./deep-dives) directory. These markdown files serve as detailed guides and references for concepts that I find particularly interesting or challenging.

## Learning Resources

Check out the [`resources.md`](./resources.md) file for a list of textbooks, online tutorials, and courses that I've found valuable during my C++ learning journey.

## Progress

Follow my progress by exploring the commit history and branches. Each commit represents a step forward in my learning process. I'm excited to look back and see how far I've come!

## Notes and Thoughts

I use the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/learning-cpp/issues) section to jot down my notes, thoughts, and questions. Feel free to join the conversation and provide insights or suggestions.
