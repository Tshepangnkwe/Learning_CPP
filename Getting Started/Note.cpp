/*
Using the using namespace std directive in C++ is generally considered a bad practice for several reasons:

Namespace Pollution: The C++ Standard Library (STD) contains a large number of classes, functions, and other entities. When you use using namespace std, you import all of these entities into the global namespace. This can lead to naming conflicts between your code and the library, especially as your codebase grows.

Name Clashes: If your code or any third-party libraries you use define identifiers with the same names as those in the std namespace, you will encounter naming conflicts. This can make your code difficult to read, understand, and maintain.

Code Readability: Explicitly prefixing identifiers with std:: (e.g., std::cout, std::vector) makes your code more readable and self-documenting. It's clear which entities are part of the C++ Standard Library, and this aids in understanding the origin of functions and classes.

Maintainability: In larger projects, it becomes essential to avoid naming conflicts and to make your code as modular and isolated as possible. Not using using namespace std encourages good coding practices by forcing you to manage namespaces and naming effectively.

Collaboration: When working on collaborative projects, other developers may have different coding styles and preferences. Not using using namespace std helps maintain consistency and prevents conflicts when combining code from multiple contributors.

Easier Debugging: Explicitly specifying the namespace helps in identifying the source of errors or ambiguities during debugging. It can be challenging to trace the origin of a particular function or class if you're using using namespace std.
