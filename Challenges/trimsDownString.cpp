/*
Create a function that trims a string down to 10 characters
Can you construct a function that accepts a string as input and returns a shortened version? There are many applications for data trimming, but consider how a tool like this would help eliminate errors in a database.

For example, in customer address data, any zip code greater than five characters would be incorrect. Trimming entires using a program like this can help keep databases clean.
