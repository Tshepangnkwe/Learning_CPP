Challenge: Age Validator

Your task is to enhance the age-checking program. Extend it to not only check if the person is 16 or older but also provide different messages based on their age:

If the age is 16 or older, welcome them and ask if they have a driving license ("Welcome! Do you have a driving license?").

If the age is between 13 and 15 (inclusive), let them know they are not allowed and suggest waiting a couple of years ("You're not allowed. Maybe in a few years!").

If the age is below 13, inform them that they are too young and should come back in the future ("Sorry, you are too young. Please come back in a few years!").
