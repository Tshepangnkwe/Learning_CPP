//We need to modify our days to seconds converter app to also work with decimal days 

/*
Time Converter

Your task is to create an interactive time converter program. The program should:

Accept input for the number of days (as a double) from the user.

Use the toSeconds function to convert the provided days to seconds (using the overloaded function).

Display the result as a double.

Then, ask the user again, but this time, accept the number of days as an integer.

Use the original toSeconds function (not the overloaded one) to convert the provided days to seconds.

Display the result as an integer.
