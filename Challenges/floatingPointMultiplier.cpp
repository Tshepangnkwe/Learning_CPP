/*
Create a floating-point multiplier program
Given two floating-point numbers, create a C++ program that gives you the product of the two.

Looking to take things up to an intermediate level? Build upon this challenge by allowing for any number of inputs (or an array of them) and returning the product of all input floating-point numbers.
